UCSC SuperPathway Database Toolkit


To get the dependencies

pip install pyaml
pip install networkx


To get the code:
git clone  hgwdev.soe.ucsc.edu:/hive/groups/cancerGB/paradigm/pathway_compiler.git

Once you have compiler:

Get a copy of the database
./scripts/pathway_db.py sync

Compile to a superpathway
 ./scripts/pathway_db.py compile --paradigm > superpathway.pid 

Compare to the old super pathway

./scripts/network_compare.py <path/to/pid_110725_pathway.tab> pid_all_pathway.tab

Please help me to start testing this data and figuring out what functions we need to write.
